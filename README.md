# LED-Chase-V3
A project where I created a sequence where the LED light "moves" back and forth, like in the Knight Rider car. This is version 3 where I utilized multiple LEDs and Arduino's pulse width modulation, potentiometers, and analog pins. Got the inspiration to do this project from Paul McWhorter's Tutorials 12-14.
